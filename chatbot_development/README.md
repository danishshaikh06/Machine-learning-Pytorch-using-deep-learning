# Explanation of GPT Implementation

This explanation provides insights into key components of the GPT model as implemented. 

## Self-Attention Mechanism

The self-attention mechanism allows each position in a sequence to attend to all positions in the previous layer, and is described by the formula:

\[
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
\]

Where:
- \( Q \), \( K \), and \( V \) are the query, key, and values.
- \( d_k \) is the dimension of keys.

In the implementation:
- `SelfAttention` and `MultiHeadAttention` classes define the core mechanism.
- Linear transformations are applied to queries, keys, and values.
- Softmax is used to calculate attention weights.

## Multi-Head Attention

Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions:
- It divides the embedding dimension by heads and performs scaled dot-product attention in parallel.
- Outputs are concatenated and projected back to expected dimensions by linear transformation.

## GPTBlock

Each GPTBlock contains:
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Performs self-attention across all words.
- **Layer Normalization and Residual Connections**: Stabilizing solution before and after blocks.
- **Feed Forward Neural Network**: Two linear layers with a non-linearity (GELU).

## Transformer Model (GPT)

The GPT model consists of:
- **Embedding Layers**: Converts input indices into dense vectors (Tokens and Positional embeddings).
- **Stack of Transformer Blocks**: Each comprises a layer of self-attention and feed-forward network.
- **Output Layer**: Projects the final hidden state into vocabulary size to decode text.

## Text Generation

The `generate` function:
- Uses greedy decoding or sampling to generate text autoregressively.
- A temperature parameter affects randomness in sampling.
- Causal masks are used to ensure tokens attend only previous tokens.

## Simple Tokenizer

For demonstration purposes:
- Converts text to sequences of IDs and vice versa.
- Includes basic vocabulary building from training data.

## Running Demonstration

### Training

The code provides a minimalistic approach to train a GPT model:
- Sample text data is used.
- The tokenizer prepares text as token sequences.
- GPT model is instantiated and demonstrated via text generation.

### Interacting with the Model

Sample interactions showcase how prompts generate completion using the trained model.

This implementation provides foundational understanding and can be expanded for more complex tasks or larger models.
